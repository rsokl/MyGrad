    Sum of tensor elements over a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ArrayLike

    axis : Optional[int, Tuple[ints, ...]]
        Axis or axes along which a sum is performed.  The default,
        axis=None, will sum all of the elements of the input tensor.  If
        axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.
        If axis is a tuple of ints, a sum is performed on all of the axes
        specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the axes as
        before.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input tensor.

    constant : Optional[bool]
        If ``True``, this tensor is treated as a constant, and thus does not
        facilitate back propagation (i.e. ``constant.grad`` will always return
        ``None``).

        Defaults to ``False`` for float-type data.
        Defaults to ``True`` for integer-type data.

        Integer-type tensors must be constant.

    Returns
    -------
    sum_along_axis : mygrad.Tensor
        A Tensor with the same shape as `self`, with the specified
        axis/axes removed. If `self` is a 0-d tensor, or if `axis` is None,
        a 0-dim Tensor is returned.

    The sum of an empty tensor is the neutral element 0:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import mygrad as mg

    Parameters
    ----------

    axis : Optional[int, Tuple[ints, ...]
        Axis or axes along which a mean is performed.  The default,

    Notes
    -----
    The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean,

    The mean is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.
    If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used
    instead.  In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an
    unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite population.
    ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the variance for
    normally distributed variables.
