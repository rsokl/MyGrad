    ----------
    arr_like : array_like
        A tensor, any object exposing the array interface, an object whose
        __array__ method returns an tensor, a real number, any (nested) sequence.

    dtype : data-type, optional
        The desired data-type for the tensor. Restricted to integer and float type.
        If not specified, then the type will be determined as the minimum type required
        to hold the objects in the sequence.

    constant : Optional[bool]
        If ``True``, this tensor is treated as a constant, and thus does not
        facilitate back propagation (i.e. ``constant_tensor.grad`` will always
        return ``None``).

        If a new tensor is returned:

    copy : bool, optional
        If true (default), or if a copy is needed to satisfy any of the
        other requirements (``dtype``, ``constant``, etc.) then a new tensor
        is created from copied data. Otherwise the tensor will be returned
        unchanged.

    ndmin : int, optional

    """A numpy-array-like object capable of serving as a node in a computational
    graph that supports back-propagation of derivatives via the chain rule.
    See the Examples section of the docstring for more details.

    Like the numpy array, mygrad's tensor stores data as an N-dimensional array
    and provides an interface accessing, setting, and performing vectorized
    operations along the various dimensions of this array. Vectorized operations
    support numpy-style broadcasting semantics.

    The contents of a tensor can be accessed and written to using all variety
    of basic and advanced indexing (along with mixtures of the two).

    Creating a Tensor
    -----------------
    ``mygrad.Tensor`` can be passed any "array-like" object of numerical data.
    This includes numbers, sequences (e.g. lists), nested sequences, numpy-ndarrays,
    and other mygrad-tensors. mygrad also provides familiar numpy-style tensor-creation
    functions (e.g. ``mygrad.arange``, ``mygrad.linspace``, etc.)

    >>> import mygrad as mg
    >>> mg.tensor(2.3)  # creating a 0-dimensional tensor
    Tensor(2.3)
    >>> mg.tensor(np.array([1.2, 3.0]))  # casting a numpy-array to a tensor
    Tensor([1.2, 3.0])
    >>> mg.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # creating a 2-dimensional tensor
    Tensor([[1, 2],
            [3, 4]])
    >>> mg.arange(4)    # using numpy-style tensor creation functions
    Tensor([0, 1, 2, 3])

    Creating a non-constant tensor will copy array data:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> arr = np.arange(10.)
    >>> t_var = tensor(arr, constant=False)
    >>> np.shares_memory(arr, t_var)
    False

    Creating constant tensor will not make a copy of the array data:

    >>> t_const = mg.tensor(arr, constant=True)
    >>> np.shares_memory(arr, t_const)
    True

    Forward and Back-Propagation
    ----------------------------
    Let's construct a computational graph consisting of two zero-dimensional
    tensors, ``x`` and ``y``, which are used to compute an output tensor,
    ````. This is a "forward pass imperative" style for creating a computational
    graph - the graph is constructed as we carry out the forward-pass computation.

    >>> x = mg.tensor(3.0)
    >>> y = mg.tensor(2.0)
    >>> ℒ = 2 * x + y ** 2

    Invoking ``ℒ.backward()`` signals the computational graph to
    compute the total-derivative of ``f`` with respect to each one of its dependent
    variables. I.e. ``x.grad`` will store ``dℒ/dx`` and ``y.grad`` will store
    ``dℒ/dy``. Thus we have back-propagated a gradient from ``f`` through our graph.

    Each tensor of derivatives is computed elementwise. That is, if `x = Tensor(x0, x1, x2)`,
    then dℒ/dx represents `[dℒ/d(x0), dℒ/d(x1), dℒ/d(x2)]`

    >>> ℒ.backward()  # computes df/dx and df/dy
    >>> x.grad  # df/dx
    array(6.0)
    >>> y.grad  # df/dy
    array(4.0)
    >>> ℒ.grad
    array(1.0)  # dℒ/dℒ

    Once the gradients are computed, the computational graph containing ``x``,
    ``y``, and ``ℒ`` is cleared automatically. Additionally, involving any
    of these tensors in a new computational graph will automatically null
    their gradients.

    >>> 2 * x
    >>> x.grad is None
    True

    Or, you can use the ``tensor.null_grad()`` method to manually clear a
    tensor's gradient

    >>> y.null_grad()
    Tensor(2.)
    >>> y.grad is None
    True

    Accessing the Underlying NumPy Array
    ------------------------------------
    ``mygrad.Tensor`` is a thin wrapper on ``numpy.ndarray``. A tensor's
    underlying numpy-array can be accessed via ``.data``:

    >>> x = mg.tensor([1, 2])
    >>> x.data
    array([1, 2])

    **Do not modify this underlying array**. Any in-place modifications made to this
    array will not be tracked by any computational graph involving that tensor, thus
    back-propagation through that tensor will likely be incorrect.

    Producing a "View" of a Tensor
    ------------------------------
    MyGrad's tensors exhibit the same view semantics and memory-sharing relationships
    as NumPy arrays. I.e. any (non-scalar) tensor produced via basic indexing will share
    memory with its parent.

    >>> x = mg.tensor([1., 2., 3., 4.])
    >>> y = x[:2]  # the view: Tensor([1., 2.])
    >>> y.base is x
    True
    >>> np.shares_memory(x, y)
    True

    Mutating shared data will propagate through views:

    >>> y *= -1
    >>> x
    Tensor([-1., -2.,  3.,  4.])
    >>> y
    Tensor([-1., -2.])

    And this view relationship will also manifest between the tensors' gradients

    >>> (x ** 2).backward()
    >>> x.grad
    array([-2., -4.,  6.,  8.])
    >>> y.grad
    array([-2., -4.])

    In-Place Operations are not Efficient
    =====================================
    It is important to note that while MyGrad's view semantics promote a rich parity
    with NumPy, that certain aspects should be avoided in the interest of optimized performance.
    Namely, performing in-place operations on tensors is generally not more efficient than
    their non-mutating counterparts.

    This is because MyGrad has to track the state of tensors that are involved in a computational
    graph. Thus a mutated tensor must have its pre-augmented state stored for future reference; this
    defeats the performance benefit of writing to an array's memory in-place. This is especially
    inefficient if you are mutating a tensor involved with multiple views of the same memory(
    By contrast, producing a view of a tensor _is_ efficient as one would expect).

    Thus these NumPy-like in-place semantics are supported by MyGrad not for the same performance
    purposes, but instead to support convenient and familiar code-patterns and to enable one to
    port NumPy code to MyGrad (or, in the future, inject MyGrad tensors into NumPy!!) and get
    the exact same behavior.

    A final note: MyGrad's in-place operations, when run under :func:`~mygrad.no_autodiff` mode,
    do not incur the extra costs noted above, and thus your code will benefit from the performance
    benefits of in-place operations.

            includes numbers, sequences, nested sequences, numpy-ndarrays,
            and mygrad-tensors.

        dtype : DTypeLikeReals
            `int`, `float`, or a real-valued numpy data type. By default the
            data type is inferred from ``x`` via ``numpy.asarray(x)``.

        constant : Optional[bool]

            facilitate back propagation (i.e. `self.grad` will always return
            ``None``).

            Defaults to ``False`` for float-type data.
            Defaults to ``True`` for integer-type data.

            Integer-type tensors must be constant.

        copy : Optional[bool]
            Determines if the incoming array-data will be copied.

        ndmin : int, optional
            Specifies the minimum number of dimensions that the resulting
            array should have.  Ones will be prepended to the shape as

        ``ℒ.backward()`` was invoked.

        If this tensor is a view of another tensor then their gradients
        will exhibit the same memory-sharing relationship as their data.

        Returns
        -------
        dℒ/dx: numpy.ndarray
            The gradient of the terminal node in a computational graph
            with respect to this tensor. The shape of this numpy array
            matches ``self.shape``

        Examples
        --------
        >>> import mygrad as mg
        >>> x = mg.Tensor([1.0, 2.0])

        Prior to backpropagation tensors have ``None`` set for their gradients.

        >>> x.grad is None
        True

        Now we trigger backpropagation...

        >>> ℒ = x ** 2
        >>> ℒ.backward()

        and we see that ``x.grad`` stores dℒ/dx

        >>> x.grad  # dℒ/dx
        array([2., 4.])

        Now we will demonstrate the relationship between gradient a view tensor
        and that of its base.

        >>> base = mg.Tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
        >>> view = base[:2]; view
        Tensor([1., 2.])

        >>> ℒ = base ** 2
        >>> ℒ.backward()

        Although ``view`` is not directly involved in the computation in ``ℒ``,
        and thus would not typically store a gradient in due to ``ℒ.backward()``,
        it shares memory with ``base`` and thus it stores a gradient in correspondence
        to this "view relationship". I.e. because ``view == base[:2]``, then we expect
        to find that ``view.grad == base.grad[:2]``.

        >>> base.grad
        array([2., 4., 6.])
        >>> view.grad
        array([2., 4.])

        >>> view.grad.base is base.grad
        True

        The reasoning here is that, because a base tensor and its view share the same
        array data, then varying an element in that data implies that both the base
        tensor and the view will change (assuming the variation occurs specifically in
        a shared region). It follows that the base tensor's gradient must share the same
        relationship with the view-tensor since these are measures of "cause and effects"
        associated with varying elements of data (albeit infinitesmaly).

        casting : Literal['no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe']
            Controls what kind of data casting may occur. Defaults to ‘unsafe’ for backwards compatibility.
                - ‘no’ means the data types should not be cast at all.
                - ‘equiv’ means only byte-order changes are allowed.
                - ‘safe’ means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
                - ‘same_kind’ means only safe casts or casts within a kind, like float64 to float32, are allowed.
                - ‘unsafe’ means any data conversions may be done.

        copy : bool, optional (default=True)
            By default, astype always returns a newly allocated array. If this is set to false, and
            the ``dtype`` and ``constant`` requirements are satisfied, the input tensor is returned
            instead of a copy.

        constant : Optional[bool]
            If specified, determines if the returned tensor is a constant.

        constant : bool, optional (default=False)

            Thus this raises if `out` is read-only.

            There is an exception to this if  a tensor is provided, in which case the

        Designating this tensor as the tensor ℒ, compute dℒ/dx for all (non-constant) tensors
        that preceded ℒ in its computational graph, and store each of these derivatives in ``x.grad``
        respectively.

        Once back-propagation is finished, the present tensor is removed from all computational
        graphs, and the preceding graph is cleared.

        If ℒ is a non-scalar tensor (i.e. ``ℒ.ndim`` is greater than 0), then calling
        ``ℒ.backward()`` will behave as if ℒ was first reduced to a scalar via summation. I.e. it
        will behave identically to ``ℒ.sum().backward()``; this ensures that each element of any
        dℒ/dx will represent a derivative of a scalar function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grad : Optional[array_like], (must be broadcast-compatible with ``self``
            By default, the present tensor is treated as the terminus of the computational graph (ℒ).
            Otherwise, one can specify a "downstream" derivative, representing ``dℒ/d(self)``.
            This can be used to effectively connect otherwise separate computational graphs.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> import mygrad as mg
        >>> x = mg.tensor(2)
        >>> y = mg.tensor(3)
        >>> w = x * y
        >>> ℒ = 2 * w
        >>> ℒ.backward()  # computes dℒ/dℒ, dℒ/dw, dℒ/dy, and dℒ/dx

        >>> ℒ.grad  # dℒ/df == 1 by identity
        array(1.)
        >>> w.grad  # dℒ/dw
        array(2.)
        >>> y.grad # dℒ/dy = dℒ/dw * dw/dy
        array(4.)
        >>> x.grad # dℒ/dx = dℒ/dw * dw/dx
        array(6.)

        Calling ``ℒ.backward()`` from a non-scalar tensor is equivalent
        to first summing that tensor.

        >>> tensor = mg.tensor([2.0, 4.0, 8.0])
        >>> ℒ = tensor * tensor[::-1]  # [x0*x2, x1*x1, x2*x0]

        # is used to represent that tensor in any non-view operations that the tensor
        # was participating in. This ensures that the stateful computational graph
        # is not corrupted by this mutation.
        #
        # Once the placeholders have been created, they have permanently replaced the
        # rolls of their counterparts within the computational graph. Furthermore, they
        # exist only internally to the computational graph and thus cannot be the targets
        # of subsequent views or in-place updates.
        #
        # At this point, the "original" tensors merely reserve the publicly-available
        # Tensor-instances (husks) that the users will access. We eventually need to
        # populate these husks with the appropriate augmented contents and graph-history.
        #
        # Thus this method will compute the in-place operation on a new tensor, and
        # will create a new, internal computational graph involving the base tensor
        # affected by the mutation and any of its view-children. These tensors represent
        # the mutated tensors that the users expect to have access to.
        #
        # We must connect this new computational graph to the preceding one – the one
        # involving the placeholders; this way we can backpropagate appropriately and
        # through all influencers.
        #
        # Finally we mirror each of these new tensors into the husks of the publicly
        # -available tensors and reroute the computational graph through them so that
        # the user sees that all of the relevant tensors have been augmented, and that
        # they are connected to the appropriate "history" such that backprop occurs
        # without error or inaccuracy.
        #
        #
        # For illustration, consider the following graph:
        #
        # ... x------[square]-- y = x**2
        #        \
        #         ---[slice]-- z = view-x
        #                              \
        #                               ---[mul]-- w = 3 * z
        #
        # Now suppose that we mutate `x` with `x[:] = 0`. This is a simpler case than
        # mutating a view of `x`, since `x` is already the base tensor.
        #  - This should not affect `y`
        #  - It should affect `view_x`
        #  - It should *not* affect `w`, which depends on `view_x` in a "static" way.
        #    I.e. the value for `w` is already resolved and is not a view of z or x.
        #
        #

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis : Optional[int, Tuple[int, ...]]
            Axis or axes along which the variance is computed.  The default is to

        The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean,
        i.e.,  ``var = mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2)``.

        The mean is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.
        If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used
        instead.  In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an
        unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite population.
